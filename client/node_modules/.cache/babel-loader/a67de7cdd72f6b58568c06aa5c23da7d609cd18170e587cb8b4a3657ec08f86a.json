My name is Amanda and I am originally from Utah. I moved up to Alaska in 2013 after working for a summer on the Alaska Railroad. I enjoy running, outdoor activities, and spending time with my many pets. I became an RBT in November 2013 and a BCaBA in February 2021. I received my Bachelor degree in 2020 with a major in History. I am currently working on my Master’s degree through Florida Institute of Technology and plan on graduating Summer of 2022 with a degree in ABA. I enjoy working with children of all ages and watching them learn and grow! </p>\n    </div>\n  </template>\n  \n  <script>\n  export default {\n    name: 'AmandaComponent'\n  }\n  </script>\n  \n  <style scoped>\n.parallax-hero {\n/* Replace with your image URL */\nbackground: url('https://aurorabehaviorservices.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/homepage-slider-paris-2.jpg') center/cover no-repeat fixed;\nheight: 500px; /* Adjust based on your preference */\ndisplay: flex;\nalign-items: center;\njustify-content: center;\n}\n  </style>\n  "],"mappings":"AAYE,eAAe;EACbA,IAAI,EAAE;AACR"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
