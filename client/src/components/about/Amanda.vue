        <p>Hi! My name is Amanda and I am originally from Utah. I moved up to Alaska in 2013 after working for a summer on the Alaska Railroad. I enjoy running, outdoor activities, and spending time with my many pets. I became an RBT in November 2013 and a BCaBA in February 2021. I received my Bachelor degree in 2020 with a major in History. I am currently working on my Masterâ€™s degree through Florida Institute of Technology and plan on graduating Summer of 2022 with a degree in ABA. I enjoy working with children of all ages and watching them learn and grow! </p>
