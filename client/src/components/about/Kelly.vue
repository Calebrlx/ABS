        <p>I am the owner/CEO of Aurora Behavior Services. We started serving Children in the Eagle River/JBER/Anchorage area in August of 2018. I have been in BCBA since 2015 and was a BCaBA before that.</p>
        <p>I am originally from Chicago, but moved to Colorado for college and met my husband, Jerry there. We lived in Fort Collins, Colorado until 2003 and then moved to Juneau, Alaska, my husband’s hometown. In 2004, we made the move to Eagle River, Alaska and have lived here ever since! Our four children, ages 8 through 16, were all born in Alaska.</p>
        <p>My educational background includes a bachelor’s degree in Biology through Colorado State University and a master’s degree in Special Education through University of Alaska Southeast. My hobbies include reading, kayaking, singing, knitting, gardening and sharing time with our many pets.</p>
